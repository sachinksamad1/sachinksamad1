I'm a passionate and results-driven Full-Stack Developer with a strong background in creating robust and scalable web and mobile applications. I specialize in a variety of technologies, allowing me to handle projects from the backend architecture to intuitive frontend experiences.

## What I Do 🚀
Full-Stack Development: I have extensive experience with the MEAN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) and Django, building comprehensive and efficient applications.

Cross-Platform Mobile Development: I use Flutter to build beautiful, high-performance applications for both iOS and Android from a single codebase. 📱

UI/UX Design: With a keen eye for design, I leverage Figma to create compelling and user-centric interfaces that drive engagement and meet business objectives. 🎨

## Open to Freelance Projects 💼
I am actively seeking new freelance opportunities and collaborations.
